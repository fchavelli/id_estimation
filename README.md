# ID Estimation

Comparison of the following intrinsic dimension (ID) estimators:

    - Grassberger and Procaccia's Correlation Integral (CorrInt)
    - Farahmand et al.'s Manifold-Adaptive Dimension estimation Algorithm (MADA)
    - Levina and Bickel's and Haro et al.'s maximum likelihood-based estimators (Levina_Bickel and MLE)
    - Rozza et al.'s Minimum Neighbour Distance-Maximum Likelihood estimators (MiND_ML)
    - Facco et al.'s Two-Nearest Neighbour estimator (TwoNN)
    - Amsaleg et al.'s method of moments estimator (MOM)
    - Hein and Audibert's U-statistic-based estimator (Hein)

The ID estimates are performed on the latent representations of dynamical systems obtained using the model from Chen et al. [here](https://github.com/BoyuanChen/neural-state-variables/tree/main)
